Q.7) write a program to check if number is divisible by 2 or not.

ans:-// number is divisible by 2 or not 
        //if output is 0 it means no and output is other than 0 it means yes
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    int x;
    printf("enter a number : "); 0
    scanf("%d" , &x);
    
    printf("%d", x % 2 == 0);
    
    return 0;
}

explaination :-

//                                  -for a statement(will not include in output)
#include <math.h>                    -to code easier for mathematical operations  
int                                 -to define a variable 
scanf                           -to take input
%d                                -defines that side is intiger
&                                    -shows the location of variable 

(note:- if output is 0(zero) it means no and output is other than 0 it means yes)
